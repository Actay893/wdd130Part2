        <h4><p>I’m Austin Cole Taylor. 
            I am From Phoenix AZ, however I don’t like the heat. 
            I love physical contact sports like M.M.A. and wrestling. 
            I have been practicing since I was 9 years old in Jiu Jitsu and then switched to wrestling when I got into high school. 
            I loved competing in tournaments and getting a good sweat in. 
            I’ve always loved pushing myself and doing hard things which is why I’ve always wanted to pursue a field in STEM, which is why I’m at BYUI pursuing Cyber Security. 
            I’m having a great time currently as I’m learning so much here and can’t wait until I can implement all these things into my day to day life with a Cyber job.

        <h2>My travels</h2>
        <p>One of my favorite things to do is to travel. 
            I have been to a couple different places and love to explore countries and see different cultures. 
            The most notable places I’ve been to are Belize and Canada. 
            I’ve gotten to see every Mayan ruin in Belize and love the history behind them, and climbing them. 
            Another thing we normally do is go fishing in Belize, which is great because there are so many different cool fish to catch and they are all so colorful. 
            I’ve been to Belize about 4 times now and plan to go back again. 
            I have also been to the Yukon River in Canada and spent about 2 weeks camping and rafting it. I love to travel and can’t wait to go to many more places that I have been wanting to go to for a while.
