        -	I’m Austin Cole Taylor. I am From Phoenix AZ, however I don’t like the heat. I love physical contact sports like M.M.A. and wrestling. I have been practicing since I was 9 years old in Jiu Jitsu and then switched to wrestling when I got into high school. I loved competing in tournaments and getting a good sweat in. I’ve always loved pushing myself and doing hard things which is why I’ve always wanted to pursue a field in STEM, which is why I’m at BYUI pursuing Cyber Security. I’m having a great time currently as I’m learning so much here and can’t wait until I can implement all these things into my day to day life with a Cyber job.
      </p>
      <p>
        -	One of my favorite things to do is to travel. I have been to a couple different places and love to explore countries and see different cultures. The most notable places I’ve been to are Belize and Canada. I’ve gotten to see every Mayan ruin in Belize and love the history behind them, and climbing them. Another thing we normally do is go fishing in Belize, which is great because there are so many different cool fish to catch and they are all so colorful. I’ve been to Belize about 4 times now and plan to go back again. I have also been to the Yukon River in Canada and spent about 2 weeks camping and rafting it. I love to travel and can’t wait to go to many more places that I have been wanting to go to for a while.

      <h3>Job Experience</h3>
      <p>
        -	At BYUI IT I get to go help faculty and students get their tech running back to normal. This has been my first semester at this job and I am getting to learn so much. I’ve had my hands on all sorts of problems such as blue screens, screen cracks, reimages and much more. I’ve had some IT experience through classes before however this job is really helping me to understand technology and how to fix it which is very handy for my major of Cyber Security I’m also glad to be doing this through the school as everyone we help out is so kind and patient even though they are experiencing computer problems, which is normally unheard of in IT. 
      </p>
      <p>
        -	I worked at Discount Tire for over 4 years and gained a lot of skills through that job. When I started at Discount I knew nothing about cars, however throughout the years I started learning all the skills and became a lead tech. I was able to work on cars, manage and lead the other techs, as well as sell the tires in the front room. I learned a lot of customer skills and sales through the front room which also comes with dealing with some angry customers and trying to turn them into happy customers. I had a lot of fun at this job, however had to leave for school in Idaho. 
      </p>
      <p>
        -	My first semester I learned AWS and firebase which I was able to webhost my website without using Github. Which here is the link to access that. https://portfolio-itm.web.app/cr.html
      </p>
      <p>
        -	I have a raspberry Pi that I have been testing on, such as RFI, Python and other things. I have been having fun with it and it has been teaching me the basics of different computer components.
