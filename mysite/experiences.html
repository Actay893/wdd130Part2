                <h3>4 Years at Discount Tire</h3>
                <p>I worked at Discount Tire for over 4 years and gained a lot of skills through that job. 
                    When I started at Discount I knew nothing about cars, however throughout the years I started learning all the skills and became a lead tech. 
                    I was able to work on cars, manage and lead the other techs, as well as sell the tires in the front room. 
                    I learned a lot of customer skills and sales through the front room which also comes with dealing with some angry customers and trying to turn them into happy customers. 
                    I had a lot of fun at this job, however had to leave for school in Idaho. </p>

                <h3>Information Technology</h3>
                <p>At BYUI IT I get to go help faculty and students get their tech running back to normal. 
                    This has been my first semester at this job and I am getting to learn so much. 
                    I’ve had my hands on all sorts of problems such as blue screens, screen cracks, reimages and much more. 
                    I’ve had some IT experience through classes before however this job is really helping me to understand technology and how to fix it which is very handy for my major of Cyber Security I’m also glad to be doing this through the school as everyone we help out is so kind and patient even though they are experiencing computer problems, which is normally unheard of in IT.</p>
