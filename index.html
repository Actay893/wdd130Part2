        <img src="/wwr/images/myphoto.jpg" alt="Image of me" style="width: 100 px; height: auto;">
        <p>I am a junior here at BYUI and my home town is Phoenix, AZ</p>
        <p>My hobbies are M.M.A. and snowboarding.</p>
        <p>I am not married, and don't have any children</p>
        <p>I see different advantages in web design as I need to know how websites work for Cybersecurity</p>
        <p>I am a convert to the church, and joined a little over a year ago</p>
        <p>My favorite scripture is 3 Nephi 14, as It really helped me see how scriptures can pop in your head when you really need them.</p>
